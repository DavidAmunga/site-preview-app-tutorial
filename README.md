# Site Preview App 

This is is the starter setup for the Site Preview App that accompanies the Dev.to Tutorial. 


First Setup your project using Tailwind through [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).
<br/>

If during your installation of Tailwind Libraries it shows a `no matches found: postcss@^7` error then install using quotes

```bash
npm install -D "tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat" "postcss@^7" "autoprefixer@^9"
```
